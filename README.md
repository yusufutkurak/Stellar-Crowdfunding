## üìë Project Description  
This project is a **decentralized crowdfunding platform** built on the **Stellar Blockchain**. The smart contract enables users to create projects, contribute funds, and claim rewards based on contribution tiers. If the project goal isn‚Äôt reached, backers can request a refund after the deadline.  

The application is powered by **Rust** for smart contracts, **Node.js** for the backend, and **React** for the front-end interface.

## üåü Vision  
Our platform seeks to empower creators and innovators by providing an efficient and transparent crowdfunding solution. By leveraging the **Stellar blockchain**, we enable secure and traceable transactions, ensuring backers can trust the process.  
We believe this project will promote the growth of decentralized funding for creative and social ventures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Software Development Plan  

### **Smart Contract Development**  
- Define structures for `Project` and `RewardTier`.  
- Implement core functions:
  - `create_project()`: Create new projects with funding goals and deadlines.
  - `fund_project()`: Allow backers to fund projects.
  - `refund()`: Refund contributions if goals are unmet within the deadline.  
- Handle errors such as expired deadlines and zero fund contributions.

### **Backend Development (Node.js)**  
- Develop endpoints for creating, funding, and refunding projects.  
- Integrate with the Stellar blockchain using CLI commands.

### **Front-End Development (React)**  
- Create forms for project creation and funding.  
- Display project progress, raised funds, and rewards dynamically.

### **Deployment**  
- Deploy the smart contract on the **Stellar testnet**.  
- Host the backend on **Heroku** or **Vercel**, and the front-end on **Netlify**.
